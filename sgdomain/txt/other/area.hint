题目:  a very good area: jieting
----------------------------------------------------------------------
jieting is a very good area,
other wizs can refer it to write your areas
because jieting is just a level 1 area
so 5 rooms are pretty suitable to it
here i will give a table for wizs to
refer
level   rooms
1      4-7
2     4-10
3    5-15
4    10-20
5    20-50
the room number here just a suggestion
if anywizs have his own ideas about his
area, can adjust this number
here i want to mention several things
(1-20 25%) [h]:
need to concern:
1 about set_area
in each area, we need all the rooms
in that area include one sentence
set_area("<area_id>")
and the area_id should keep the same
for all the rooms in this area
for example, all the room in jieting
need include one sentence:
set_area("jieting")
2 path
for areas with level 4 and 5
place path under /sgdomain/area/cities/<area_id>
for example changan will be in
/sgdomain/area/cities/changan
for areas with level 3
please put in under /sgdomain/area/town/<area_id>
for areas with level 1 and level 2
place it under /sgdomain/area/guan/<area_id>
to check a area's level please use:
(21-40 51%) [h]:
listarea /1;
or info a <area_id>
2
3 meeting room and fly room
for each area, we need at least two important rooms
meeting room and fly room
the meeting room is an in_door room
and the fly room in a out_door room
meeting room is the place where all the local meeting
are hold and in sometime the leader of this area will
stay
the fly room is used for player to use fly <area_id>
to fly to that place, and used for that place to
distrubite army
4 map
each area need a local map
with the name is <area_id>.map
and should be placed on /sgdomain/txt/maps/
5 setarea
when one area has been or halfly has been finished
(41-60 77%) [h]:
use setarea to install the information into the
system
useage:
setarea <area_id> map <area_id>
setarea <area_id> fly <fly_room>
setarea <area_id> meeting <meeting_room>
setarea <area_id> path <the path>
for example
setarea jieting map jieting
setarea jieting fly jt_area
setarea jieting meeting jt_ysht
setarea jieting path /sgdomain/area/guan/jieting/
setarea jieting area jieting
6 any wiz has any problem about writing areas
please ask me or just post here
thanks
