地区的金，粮，物资的基本计算公式:
gold from one month
income:
population/25. * bussiness/100. * (safe+20)/100. * tax/100. * (random(30)+ 70)/100.
outcome:
solider number /10 +
first level offical 100 gold
second level offical 50 gold
third level offical 10 gold
fourth level offical 5 gold
fivth level offical 1 gold
if income + storage < outcome
the solider will leave until the number get balance
maxmum 300,000
food:
population*10. * agriculture/100. * (safe+20)/100. * tax/100. * (random(30)+ 70)/100.
this is for one year:
outcome: 
solider number one month
if income + storage < outcome
the solider will leave until the number get balance
300000*10.*100/100*120/100*40/100*100/100 - 30000 /10 - 100 -50*2 -10 * 5 - 20
maxmum 3,000,000
stuff
income:
population/100. * industry/100. * (safe+20)/100.* (random(30)+ 70)/100.
output
solider number /100
for one month
if income + storage < outcome
the solider will leave until the number get balance
the rate of stuff / solider is the 武装度
maxmum 300,000
the common price is
1 gold = 10 food
1 gold = 2 stuff
