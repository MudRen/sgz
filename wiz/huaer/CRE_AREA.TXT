                              建立地区area的指令
==========================================================================
first make sure the map is there, check
/sgdomain/txt/maps/
and according to the level of city, 1-2 area belong to
/sgdomain/area/guan/
3 area belongs to /sgdomain/area/town/
4-5 area belongs to /sgdomain/area/cities/
so...when u r rdy to add an area, goto its dir and create
a dir there, such as add beiping 北平:
cd /sgdomain/area/cities/, mkdir beiping(不能建目录)
==============================已经做过了===================================

@AREA_D->add_area("beiping")
@AREA_D->set_area("beiping","name","北平")
@AREA_D->set_area("beiping","level",4) 

/cmds/area/addarea （在/a/下面建一个文件，可以开始造房间）
/cmds/area/initarea （把所有地区都加了之后在运行这个）
/cmds/area/createwarroom （这步warroom已经全部建好了）

then run a cmd under fire's dir:
/wiz/fire/cmds/initarea.c, this cmd will create a tmp room and a tmp
warroom for the new area, and i recommand u run this cmd after u create
all new area.（这步不需要了）
next step: use buzzer
then: setting, u should know that, "fly","meeting","prison","go","entry",etc.
and..erase the tmp.c. at last u may add mafu and bed, and makers.
maybe i missed sth, if meet problem, ask me anytime, addoil.
