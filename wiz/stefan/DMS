TITLE: Document Management System
Hmm, let's classify those documents first, here are several 
categories I have in mind:
1. player commands help.  
2. General mud help.                                
3. San Guo help.
   This is specifically to this San Guo mud.

The above is for players, now for wizs:
1. Rules, regulations, notices, etc.
2. General help on mud building.
3. LPC help.
4. Lima specific help on functions, securities, etc.
5. San Guo construction reports/plans/progress/subjects/etc.   
    
Above are only meant for helps, now for general documents:
1. Code documentation. Coders should write it, but need us to remind them.
2. News archive. News system shall be rewritten to fit in with our 
   general document system. Currently News group will blow up soon
   when news become larger & larger.
3. Mail archive. Current mail system works fine already, but might
   need some changes in order to integrate together with the document
   management system.
Any good suggestions? What I plan to do is such a system that:
* enables user to quickly browse through documents of any kind,
  of course, depending on his/her privileges, and easy to make
  references.
* has a powerful search tool to get to answers of any problems.    
* will be something like HELP in Windows, but of course, we can    
  not have links for users to click, but we can do it in some
  other way, for example, use annotations such as ¢Ù¢Ú¢Û to mark  
  links, and user just has to type 1 2 3 to go to that link...

Addoil!
