I have the following plan to do the command parsing:

The current parser handles a number of primitives:
"OBJ", "LIV", "STR", "WRD", "OBS", "LVS".
I think OBS and LVS should be removed, since Chinese does not
enforce plural form. As a replacement, two other 
primitives are : "MY", "ENV". They are used to indicate where
the OBJ or LIV are. A example is:
Rule like "eat MY OBJ". "eat dumpling" will match this rule,
and only the dumpling in "my" inventory will be looked up.
This avoids most unclear match of OBJs and LIVs.

Another example:
Rule like "kill ENV LIV". "kill dog" will match this rule,
and only the dog in the same environment of "me" will be looked up.
So if you or somebody in the same environment are carrying
a dog, that dog will not be matched.

Third example:
Rule "look at OBJ" will match OBJ against any objects in your
inventory, in the environment, and in the objects in the evironment
, recursively to the deepest inventory of virtually any OBJ in your 
environment. So "look at hat" will match this rule, and hat
of "mine", hat on the "ground", hat of another person in the same room
will all be looked up. In order to solve this problem, you
can use "look at my hat", this will also match rule "look at OBJ",
but only hat on "me" is looked up. And "look at hat" will
match hat in your environment. Hat's on somebody else will
never be refered unless you have another rule says "look at OBJ
of OBJ", which requires a different rule handler in LPC code.
This will cause many of the current verbs to fail, however, we can
change them to these new rules.
