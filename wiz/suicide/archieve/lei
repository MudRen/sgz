题目: present plan
日期: Thu Jan 22 08:13:16 1998
Before the end of Feb, archs will work on mudlib and try to finish all bugs if
possible:) Wangcl and Row will make a complete plan of which 20 cites we will
have, whose npc will in those cities, and the particular city and npc's 

background... after they finish that, we can allocate all cities to different
wizards, you may choose to write a particular city as well.
Also after that, archs will add combat.c war system... "exp" system..
So hope we can open this mud for testing in May, and open it in
following month.

If some1 has some good idea of plan(all plans), pls dont feel hesitate to tell
us, just post here, every proposal will be carefully consided. 
You are very welcome... and I will try to give u feedback as soon as possible.

日期: Thu Jan 22 08:07:14 1998
I may be going to reduce my login time.
I have 2 tough subjects this semester which is totally new to me, however
all my local classmates have learned them before. So I need to put more 
effort... In the other hand, I didnot pfm well last semester, also need to 
study hard lah...
Later I may login 2-3 times a week(hope I can do that)... When I am not here
I hope fire and gaia can take my position.
I will still have the rights of promotion and desicion of plan(I think I will
have time to think about them which is just tooo important)
同志们 ， 在烈火的旗帜下奋勇前进吧。
