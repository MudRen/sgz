usually, if we want a npc react for some triggers
we use inherit M_TRIGGERS which unfortunately has

a wrong message.
now i changed a little of m_triggers to fix this
bug. but if you want npc react in some situation
you need add several addition lines of code
void receive_outside_msg(string str){
    receive_outside_msga(str);
}
void receive_private_msg(string str) {
    receive_outside_msga(str);
}

ÌâÄ¿: score, skills, normal_d.c
ÈÕÆÚ: Sun Feb  8 22:48:14 1998
wizards now can use score and skills on players and
objects.  the side effect is you can score non-living
things if it is in your environment, but you cannot
do that to all npcs and objects.

about the bug reported on news fire:36 and subsequent
posts, i used to get a bug when i try to login myself
the second time, ÄãÒÑ¾­ÔÚÏßÉÏÁË! 
ÄãÈ·¶¨ÒªÌæ»»Âğ£¿yes
then get errors...which trace back to normal_d.c
if answer 'no' i login fine (which should be the
right thing for wizards).  i have modified normal_d.c
and backup of old normal_d.c is at normal_d.d, it 
solved the problem i was having, hope that is all the
problem with normal_d.c  :)

ÈÕÆÚ: Sun Mar  1 08:54:55 1998
now introduce four important property in cloth(armor), horse

they are attack ablity (determine the chance to hit the target)
attack power (determine the damage of the target if hit)
defence ablity (determine the chance to be hiten by the target)
defence power (determine the damage of oneself if be hitten by others)
look example of /wiz/fire/obj/horse1.c, /wiz/fire/obj/wear/ji.c and
/wiz/fire/obj/wear/jia.c to see how to add this feature in the 
object of clothes(armor), horses and weapons.
players can use score to check these figures
as example:
µ¥Ìô¹¥»÷Á¦£º  600 [110] µ¥Ìô·ÀÓùÁ¦£º  500 [100]
here attack ablity is 600
attack power is 110

ÈÕÆÚ: Mon Jan  5 23:07:13 1998
now involve a new command checkemote
usage : checkemote filter switch
filter is used to limit the search range of semotes
if * means all semote, a means all the semote begin from a
ki means all the semote begin from ki
there are three switches : /l, /s and /c
/l is the default. /l will list the semotes similar to feelings
/s will show the structure of filtered semotes 
/c will show the effect of filtered semotes
/s just opened to wizs
for some reason
checkemote * /c will just display most of the semote instead of all
so if want to get a through list of the content of semote
it's better to use checkemote x /c
x means a, b, c, ... z
good luck

1 the cost for mubing becomes soldiers number * 20 for gold as well as food
2 one city can only mubing once per year, either in april or in october
3 the formula for the soldiers got becomes

ÌâÄ¿: a litte bug
ÈÕÆÚ: Fri May 19 03:35:26 2000
now if an area doesn't have a leader.
the system will only select other npc officers in
that country to become a new leader.
so there is no chance for a no-country npc to become
a leader automically.
this bug is reported by hufei.
so hufei can ask for some reward :)
