题目: a very useful function in char_d
日期: Mon Dec 21 15:46:41 1998
//:FUNCTION appear
//This is a very useful function for put chars
//useage: CHAR_D->appear(string char_id,string area_id,string
where,string action)
//the char_id is the must parameters, if no area_id or area_id==""
//the system will select randomly an area
//where means where to put this char if "fly" in the fly room
//if "meeting" in the meeting room otherwise random room in the area
//the action used to show what the char do when he appear in that
//room, if let it blank then system will use default action
//to announce his appearance
//example: CHAR_D->appear("zhang fei") means put zhang fei in whatever

日期: Sun Oct  4 20:28:19 1998
if that npc is a char
then you can use responda
for example
> @CHAR_D->find_char("zhang fei")->responda("whisper fire xixi")
张飞对你耳语道：xixi.
if that is not a char npc
then you should make that char inherit m_action
for detail you can check the npc girl

题目: 如何写太守分配的JOB
日期: Wed Mar 10 02:27:30 1999
开发太守分配任务指南
1 定义任务ID
2 在/sgdomain/event/ev_job 中注册
如果是初级工作，加在：simple_offer=(["findbody" : "找人"]);
如果是中级工作 加在：leader_offer=([ "letter" : "送信" , "spy" : "地区侦查"]);
如果是高级工作，加在：simple_offer=(["findbody" : "找人"])
3 在job_d 中注册
=============================================================
@JOB_D->set_job("findbody","name","找人")
登记名称
-------------------------------------------------------------
@JOB_D->set_job("findbody","level",0)
设定等级
-------------------------------------------------------------
@JOB_D->set_job("findbody","count_lasttimes",10)
设定每天最多重复次数
===============================================================
4 建立路径和文件
路径是 /sgdomain/job/findbody/
文件是 /sgdomain/job/findbody/findbody.c
注意，路径与文件明必需与JOBID一致
5 编写控制文件。
下面以findbody.c 为例。
==============================================================
mixed job(string m_id,string officer_id)
所有的JOB 都以这个函数为入口
第一个参数是JOB申请者的ID，第二个参数是太守的ID
---------------------------------------------------------------
. . . . . . 判断是否可以安排工作 . . . . .
----------------------------------------------------------------
	return "$N对$T道：现在没谁好找呀。\n";
如果没有办法安排JOB，返回一个字符串解释原因。
----------------------------------------------------------------
可以分配工作:
o->set_asklist("come","target",target);
设置工作中间变量。
请参考：/sgdomain/modules/m_ask.c
通常为了实现 LIV1 ask LIV2 about sth 我们在 LIV2 的文件中加入
add_question(sth,sth); 。但如果希望只是临时加一个问题到LIV2
同时希望只有LIV1可以问这个问题。则我们可以用:
LIV1->set_asklist(sth, "target", ID of LIV2)
这一句可以使LIV1 ask LIV2 about sth 成立
-----------------------------------------------------------------
o->set_asklist("come","filename",PJOB+"findbody/findbody");
o->set_asklist("come","funname","ask_come");
这两句告诉系统当LIV ask LIV2 about sth 时，系统执行哪一个文件
中的哪个函数。语法是：
LIV1->set_asklist(sth,"filename", filename);
LIV1->set_asklist(sth,"funname", function name);
------------------------------------------------------------------
  o->add_job("findbody");
  o->set_job("findbody","status","begin");
  o->set_job("findbody","memo","找"+CHAR_D->get_char(target,"name")+
"("+target+")");
设置JOB，JOB 状态，JOB参数和JOB备注
--------------------------------------------------------------------   
   return "$N对$T道：那就麻烦$R去帮我找一下"+
	   CHAR_D->get_char(target,"name")+"("+target+")"+
	   "，\n见面就说ask "+target+" about come 。\n";
任务分配成功，返回说明语句。
}
====================================================================
void ask_come(object me, object target)
每一个临时加入的问句( LIV1 ask LIV2 about sth) 都需要一个function
来控制整个过程。第一个参数是发问者，第二个参数是对象。
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	me->targetted_action(
      "$N对$T笑着说道：本地"+m_title+"有请$R\n",target);
显示提问
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	DELAY_D->delay_targetted_action(
		target,me,"$N对$T道：知道了，随后就去，谢谢$R。\n",1);
显示回答，加入延时使得对话更真实。(见：/daemons/delay_d.c)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	me->clear_asklist("come");
清除这个临时问题。
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	me->set_job("findbody","status","done");
表示任务已经完成，注意这里不能用 me->finish_job
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	tell_user(m_id,"%^H_GREEN%^任务完成，快去太守处领赏吧。\n%^RESET%^");
通知玩家任务完成。
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	return;
}
=====================================================================
6 写help 文件
名称与JOBID一样
拷贝到/help/player/sanguo/job/路径下
update /daemons/sghelp_d.c
7 装入help 系统
执行helpediter
input t "t)  修改主题标题(Title)"
input JOBID; input 中文名称 如:初级工作之找人; enter
input a "a)  把一主题加入一类(AddClass)"
input JOBID; input job ;出现：findbody 加入 job 类，成功! 
input q "q)  退出 "
大功告成。

memo of war system.
the system of war is just beginning, and i find it also
be a very complex system. here is the memo for it and
any wizs have interesting about the war system, can check
the following files and get the idea how the war will is
managed
1 batfield
     txt: /sgdomain/txt/warmap/*      this is all the warmap
  daemon: /daemons/map_d.c            handle the database of warmap
  module: /std/grid_room.c            all the real battle field 
                                      room is inherited from this
          /sgdomain/modules/war_grid.c file to control the create of
                                      war room object
  object: in each path of the area
          with the name of warroom.c  the file to used load the room
2 troop
  daemon: /daemons/troop_d.c          the daemon to manage the troop
                                      database.
  module: /sgdomain/modules/m_troop.c all troops are inherited from 
                                      this file.
  object: /stdomain/modules/troop.c   the object of troop.
3 ai
  daemons: /daemons/warai_d.c         to handle all the fomular for
                                      war system and give non-player
                                      controled troop some basic instruction
4 event
  main: /sgdomain/event/ev_war.c      the main program to process the event
                                      of war
  annext all files under /sgdomain/event/war the main will inherit all this
                                      files
5 support
  
  daemons: task_d.c                   this will give the trigger for the

题目: call out
日期: Thu Jul 30 05:55:19 1998
There is a wiz command "calls" to show every pending call_out.
I suggest you use a string in your call_out function, instead of
(: something :) such that the name can show up in the "calls" command.

So change your call_out( (: some_function :), ..., ...) to
call_out( "some_function", ..., ...)

Internally, (: something :) will still be changed to "something" if
this "something" is actually a function call. Of course, if "something"
is not an actually function but some expressions, you can not do this change.

题目: good work, flee
日期: Tue Aug  4 08:24:36 1998
you really do a very good work
especially in such a short time
your problem about the wuli is that
you used to set the gift
and then it change to skills
the relation of them is that
one char's gift determine his max skills
in the related field
the fomular is that
max skills = 30 * gift + 40
so the resonable gift range is from 10 to 30
that will make the maxmum skills level
from 60 to 100.
so if you want a 100 wuli just set the gift 
to 30 an you perhaps will get one

题目: char menu
日期: Tue Aug  4 22:52:20 1998
Got some suggestions here:
1. At the menu input, one should input the command and also the 
argument. for example, "l group" will list group.
This is often faster than go down the menu one by one.

2. For char menu, the list command if applied to some name, it should
list the attributes of that char.

题目: about the char menu
日期: Wed Aug  5 00:16:11 1998
be careful to use the char menu
because for each char, there are 
many paras and most them have
complex relations, so if just modify
one para without consider others, in some
case may cause conflict. 
for example we change the area of
dong zhuo to changan, that will be accept
by the char menu system. but in fact
we know dong zhuo is a king and changan
is the capital city of another country
then that will cause the system confused
so be careful to use charmenu, when
you modify sth for testing, remember to
change it back

题目: All about color
日期: Thu Jul 30 05:49:25 1998
As we know, Lima has this "user configurable color" thing. But we did
not make too much use of it. But from now on, I urge you guys to 
stop HIR etc etc thing in any of your programs.

1. What are the colors that are configurable?
Currently only four of them are in use, but we can add more.
type command "colours" you will know. ROOM_EXIT, TELL, CHANNEL, MORE.
A user can use command 'colours' to change any of the four colors.
Try it out, you will know how great it is.

2. How to make color in your code?
You can use any color directly, but not HIR, HIY things. Lima uses a
special way to mark color code. For example, color YELLOW can be made
into the string by % and ^ and YELLOW and % and ^ again. Take a look at
/cmds/player/tell.c  you will know what I mean. It is also the way we
use configurable colors. "%" + "^" + "ROOM_EXIT" + "%" + "^" will give
you a color of ROOM_EXIT. To check out standard color name used here,
check /std/modules/m_ansi.c.
If we code in such a way, a user can turn all color off if he does not
want any color even if he is using a color terminal. And also, a user
can set up his own color map for everything.

3. Can we add in more configurable colors?
Of course the list of 4 is really limited. But as mud designers, we should
be careful and keep a good style. If you think something need a general
color to mark it, for example, all NPC's name can differs from all player
names in color, so as to tell whether somebody is NPC or not easily.
You can raise your suggestions and we can discuss on it then make changes.
Another example might be different channels to have different colors.

Colour is configurable is definitely better than you 'hard-code' every color 
in your code. Please take note of this great feature.

题目: >re flee
日期: Thu Jul 23 22:41:20 1998
add on the the first question flee raised "local command for an object".
1. add_action(..) is messy, especial when there are several objects 
with add_action(...) in one room. You can see it in ES2 lib. For example,
you can never eat the second chicken leg on you unless you finish the
first one. Though chicken leg stuff may not be so significant, but there
are more important cases which will be messed up by add_action(...).

2. add_action(...) complicates the command system. Every wiz does his
own add_action(...), with English name, or Chinese name, and it is very
hard to unify. Players need to ask around so as to find some special
command only meaningful to one or two rooms.

3. Removing add_action(...) and use the verb system does not mean
less flexibility in designing mud. It is always good to follow a standard
than to mess around. So, try to use standard command for possible
actions you can think of.
In some extreme cases, you may need really special command who does not
belong to current verbs, you better think again :) Why do you need such
"extreme special" command. Anyhow, the current verb vocabulary is already
quite large.

题目: re flee
日期: Thu Jul 23 20:38:43 1998
1 to bind a special function to an object is a
lettle difficult in this mud.
so in most case, unless that require is pretty necessary
we won't add extra command for certain object
later, we will try to add an special command:
use for all those special objects
then i will show you how the command "use"
be installed in this mud, and if an object
has some special useage, how to activity it
2 about npc:
according to current situation, in this mud
we have 4 different types of npcs
I will explain them from the simple to complex
the first type is the most simple type
which is inherited from LIVING
the living is in /std/living.c
this kind of npc can't fight and kill
so no need to set their hp at all
the second type is inherit from MONSTER
that is /std/monster.c
this kind of npc can fight and kill
this kind of npc, i think we can call it
monster npc. the third type of npc
is copy of /sgdomain/modules/m_charnpc
this kind of npc can fight and kill and it is
totally controled by the ai system so it's
no need to worry about the seting hp of it
this kind of npc is called char npc.
the last type of npc is also copy of /sgdomain/modules/m_charnpc
and it is called player char npc.
when a player become a char and after he log out
if we need it's char to wake to do sth
we create such kind of npc
in most part the char npc and player char npc
are same, but for some ai part, we will
introduce some difference to protect the players
right.
In this mud, monster just for quite limited
situation, so when wizs write npc for certain
areas, please just use living npc
that kind of npc can't fight and kill
but can be used to make most quest
just like kong yi ji and shuijing 
anyway, all function about hp is stored
in /sgdomain/modules/m_sggift.c
and a wiz can use flist obj to give
a list of function and the position of that function
for most objects

题目: about the seting of daemons data
日期: Mon Jul 13 21:22:09 1998
stefan's suggestion about use a plain txt file to 
input large amount of data for the char_d and area_d is
quite good, that is what i have thought before
but in the first step testing, I need to finish
task quick so didn't do all the things in a 
perfect way. 
In the next step, we should write some code for
daemon so that it can get large amount of data 
from one initial file.
but here, has one thing to concern is that this
is a dynamical mud. so we need to be clear what
data is still and what data is dynamic and enen
for some dynamicl data, we still need some initial
paras so that it can reach its stable limit
quick. for example, for an area, the name
and id and the level should be still parameters. 
but the population, gold, and food will be dynamic
paras, but in order to make the population to
a reasonable value, the initial value is quite
necessary.
setfan's suggestion is pretty good, and we will  that is a 
make that system in later stage

题目: Chinese & English
日期: Sun Jul 12 23:21:49 1998
Regarding the naming convention, I suggest all objects use english
names as their id, exception for people's names.
People's name should follow standard PinYin if they got a real name,
people like farmer, waiter etc with no real name should follow
english name.

And also, I suggest a daemon to control new player's id & name.
Two players' ids of course can not be the same, and I want to restrict
it further so that, two player's Chinese name must also not be the same.

This might also be useful to keep player from using existing famours NPCs
Chinese name, like 诸葛亮 etc.

The final point I want to make is, in room descriptions, we should cancel
those english ids appended to their Chinese names. (also for other
description).
We should maintain a English to Chinese & Chinese to English name translation
for players to use. For example, if you see a 木桶 in the room, you can
'look at 木桶' if you can input Chinese, you can also check up the translation
'translate 木桶' you got 'bucket', then you 'look at bucket'. In this
way we not only keep consistent of all objects common ids, but also we
build a friendly inputing system for them.

What do you guys think?

题目: daemon data setting
日期: Sun Jul 12 23:09:37 1998
I had a look at char_d & area_d and found there are many parameter
setting functions. When the data amount gets larger, it may be very
tedious to maintain all of them by calling setting functions.

I suggest these daemons use writing to a file & parsing from a file
to maintain all of their data. In this way, we just have to
modify a plain file in order to make changes.

How do you guys think?
