commnado should not be recruited, if so will break
current balance of defance and attack.

and your product line is too long. 
we need to calculate the power useage and the final product.

so in the first step. dont got it too complex, and base stuff system
is very flexible, so if we think it is necessary, we can always 
expand it easily

bcoz now i am working on the base->stuff plan, and I created a 
new serial of product line: cotton->yarn->calico->cloth->uniform/banner
thus I think the recruit->train->upgrade can be in this way:
after recruiting ppl, they will become only commando, after the area
has uniform and banner, and the train and morale more than 50, they become
footman, then continue upgrade .:P
