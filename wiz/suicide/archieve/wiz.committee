agreed,
but to be frank, i am quite disappointed about him.
we recruit him, let him asscess code, but all he done
is ftp everything back without approval from anybody.
when we discover that and ask for explanation, he give no
reply.
as a team, we have to trust each other. 
i do hope that roro(emporer) can do something to get
our trust again.

well, let me explain a little bit.

emperor is not roro, but roro's friend. after roro got 
our code, he passed it to emperor. according to emperor,
he will make sure it does not get to any other person.

emperor is quite good technically, I actually talked to him
several times regarding some web server topics. he is very
keen in helping sanguo development as well.

just see how he performs.

ÌâÄ¿: many wiz applications nowadays
ÈÕÆÚ: Mon Jan 24 10:35:28 2000
I got many wiz applications recently, from suicide, from phoenix, from
xfan, etc etc. 

They all did answer the questions, and they all seem to qualify.
But another reason I think is that we are getting other people's
attention because our mud is different. I also do not want
the mudlib stealing to happen again.

Generally, I would agree with fire's prior decision, if a player
applies for wiz
possition, he should have played the mud for quite some time.

But it is still hard to make a choice when many people are
applying :PP

ÌâÄ¿: About the tasklist.
ÈÕÆÚ: Sun Jan 23 19:03:44 2000
Recently, because I just work, so I am too busy to spend
much time here. Now it seems I get certain reputation in
our company, so I have more free time to do what I like,
Therefore I will be here about two hours each day at about
 7:00-9:00 am. So it is time for us to finish some long term
tasks in the MUD. As far as I know, flee and group are 
doing war stuffs such as jimou and multi-type troops. Row and
Ice don't have major tasks this moment. The following is
a draft tasklist for our wiz team. Please discuss and put
comments.
1 Row and Ice try to build a law system. I think we all have
  some unpleasant experience to handle confilcts among players.
  I assume the best way to get rid of this kind of headache is
  to settle some law and let's players to deal it themselves.
  Now we have a constitution. But we still need at least some
  law about penalty, reward and rules to handle the conflict 
  among players. I suggest row and ice to do the following things:
  a. write some clear rules for penalty, reward and recover issues.
  b. try to build a court and give rules for a player to become
     a judge or a member of the jury. So for any players' petition.
     It will become a case in the court, and the final decision will
     be given by the court (the judge, jury and lawer will be only 
     players. The wiz will be just someone to execute :)
  c. In order to realize this law system. Row and Ice need to write
     some ideas and the working process first. Then begin to code.
     I think we need some rooms, a board and a channel at least to
     realize this kind of thing.
  d. Anything envolve wizs or system security will go directly to wiz 
     committee. (The player court just handle conflicts among players).
  e. Row and Ice will be the only wizs who have the right to recover
     players data or do some penalty which is decided by the players'
     account. 
2 Flee and Group will continue the jimou and multi troop until they are
  finished. They have done a lot good work, but I am not clear about the
  details. I'd like them to give clear documents and put everything in 
  the help so we can easily test.
3 I will continue the house system and begin the frame of base system.
  I am going to make it very flexible and extendable. When the structure
  work is done, other wizs and adjust it and add new stuffs very easily.
  And I will also responsible to give clearly documents for this part.
4 Tset doesn't login regularly. So we can't rely her on any tasks. But
  if she has time, please go around and try to pick up something she like:)
5 Stefan is successfully get us this new server. He will continue on the
  MudOs work and responalbe the opening mirrors and web designing.
In this tasklist, we have 5 tasks, the first three related to the game 
designing of this MUD. I hope the the major developer in each task group 
(point row, flee), please post your detailed plan and schedules.

suicide pass all our wiz application requirement
so I promote him a new wizard,
his plan is following

   First i want to be player helper to do some simple job to
familiar with this system. 
   Include:
     1  answer player question.
     2  report and fix the bug that players met.
     3  add emote.
     4  write help file that players most need.
     5  redraw the map which corresponding area had 
        been modified.
     6  collect player's good post.
     7  suggest improvement idea in program.
   Second when i have done all this above well i will be
familiar with the system ,then i can attend some system 
development and suggest new interesting system.

   Last for more sub system need more system performance.maybe
the program we composed is not considered about optimization.
so i want to do some program optimization work.  


his first task is to create some image files for base system
and update some help files

just before I promot carlis, I checked the login records
and find that carlis come from 202.96.145.* and there is no
body from there, so he has no dummy and not a char yet.
so he didn't really play in the mud a lot but he has spend
so much time to answer all the question perfectly. this is
a little strange, so i think it's better for us to hold giving
him a wiz position until he is at least a good player

i agree with row, we should recruit him but minitor
his behavior. we need to make sure that he come here

Most of the time, if you want to send a message to an object or group
of objects, the correct function to use is tell()>>  tell(ob, str) is
the correct way to send the message str to the object ob (and just
that object
it isn't propagated to the objects inventory or
environment or anything)>>  If a third argument is passed, it is used
as the message type>>  It is also possible to use an array of objects
as the first argument>>  The message is then sent to all the objects in
the array>>  For example, tell(users(), Hi there!) sends the message
to everyone who is logged in>>
 objects simply forward the message to their user>>  bodies() could be
(161-180 50%) [h]:
 used in the above, and the effect would be the same>>]
For convenience, there is also a tell_user(name, msg), which tells the
user name (if any) the message>>  tell_user(yourname, >>>>>>) can be
handy for debugging>>
There also exist non-private messages, which in addition to sending
the message to a particular object, also automatically propagate to
other objects which are able to see the event>>  The most useful of
these is tell_environment(ob, msg), which also sends the message to
everything in the environment of ob (if any)>>  The message will also
propagate up and down through the object hierarchy, unless blocked by
some non-transparent object>>  tell_from_inside() and tell_from_outside()
are lower level versions
tell_from_inside() sends the message to a
particular object, propagating up and down, which tell_from_outside()
propagates down only>>
tell_from_inside(), tell_from_outside(), and tell_environment() also
support a fourth argument containing an array of objects which should
not hear the message>>
compatibility notes
For those used to the old efuns, the following may be helpful:
tell_object() is for the most part replaced by tell()>>
tell_room() usually becomes tell_from_outside() (with the exception that
    the extremely common construct 'tell_room(environment(ob), >>>>>>)'
    should use tell_environment(ob, >>>>>>))
say() also becomes tell_environment(this_object(), >>>>>>) in most cases,
    although when done from an non-living object it becomes
    tell_environment(this_body(), >>>>>>)
write() and printf() still work
though they are simul'ed to use
    tell(this_user(), >>>>>>), which works exactly the way the old efuns
    did, except that wrapping and color translation are done>>

support all, but since everyone disagree the penalty so much,
try to deduct some gold instead to be warning?  I suggested
to deduct the statistics of rob, I should apologize for
not realizing what our rules r not ready at present, but now
row's rules r fine enough to be in the public, fire
can give the penalty and at the same time, announce the rule
I may add it in help rules.

ÌâÄ¿: demote inactive wizs
ÈÕÆÚ: Tue Jan  4 21:07:53 2000
now i am suggesting to demote inactive wiz.
they r: zhanpu, guangfeng, yuyin, roro.

for zhanpu and guanfeng, they havent shown themselves
for a long time, as for the rules, they have to be de-
moted. however, as we all can see, they've done great 
jobs for sanguo in the past, such as that zhanpu put
sanguo on his web page as a very good advertising, gu-
anfeng created lots of objs, which have been proved v-
ery useful.  so if they return in future and r willing
to take back their job, we may recover their positions.

for yuyin, i should say infact yuyin did nothing for 
sanguo, which is regretful.  so, if yuyin is able to 
hand in his tasklist b4 next restart, we may reconsid-
er this decision.

for roro, we have record shows that roro has ftped all
sanguo's lib for unknown reason and didnt give explan-
ation as we required yet.  so be frankly, if roro app-
lied wiz post just for the lib, he is wasting his time,
as well as ours. becoz stefan is working on lib relea-
se job, so at that time, every interested person has 
the same right to share and develop sanguo lib. there-
for, there is no reason for roro to keep his position
here anymore.

i am sorry to make such proposal, actually, but for w-
iz's decipline, i have to.

hope other admins and wizs give ur opinion as soon as 
possible for settling this earlier.

1 agree
2 agree
3 ¹úÊ¦'s power will be the same, but to become a ¹úÊ¦ need more national
  contribution. Currently it is 300. How about change it to 500?
  
  Well, since the power will be the same, let's bring some more limitation
  bah.
  1) add a aggresive requirement of ¹úÊ¦£¬when a player's nationcontri
     arrives 500, he will become ¹úÊ¦£»every 3 sanguo yrs will be the
     period of reconsideration, a qualified ¹úÊ¦ must have 1000 more
     nationcontri each 3 sanguo yr, otherwise he will be demoted
  2) ¹úÊ¦ cannot change national capital
 cannot pos king to other cities
     and king will always be the taishou of the national capital.
  3) ¹úÊ¦ also will be evaluated every 3 years, if in this evaluation there
     is one or more players have higher nationalcontribution than ¹úÊ¦£¬
     system will choose randomly from them.
4  I remember there is a plan about officers' requirement, if fire can 
   combine with lch's idea, it'll be much better, and also make it can
   be viewed by player that which position need to achieve which level,
   anyway, I still suggest add a random factor to the officers' requirement.
5  agree.....*point
6  well, I suggest to make some change in the requirement and something in
   penalty in penalty:
   
   1) 50,000 reputation, 2000 localcontri, 5000 nationcontri.
   2) if ind, officers in the same city will be random leave, not like b4,
      all will absolutely leave...... (*poor liyu)
   3) if a king's nation is ruined, his equipment will be demoted to none, and
      his money will be decreased to 1/10 and it won't be more than 1000 gold
      in total...
7  I think surrender is a good start of foreign relationships, but I
suggestion
   to add some penalties in both surrenders and ìøÈÃ£º
   
   1) if surrender, the lost king will lose 90% of his reputation
 if ìøÈÃ£¬the
      former king will lose 60% of his reputation.
8  fire, u said u r modifying the house system, I think u r working in the
   system of functional rooms, is that right?  I am interested to provide a 
   real estate plan which may also include some financial plan of sanguo, like
   loans from bank, interests if deposit in bank, and might be possible to pay
   money in parts...... but ......  I'll work out the texture plan, and ......
   u make the plan true bah :)
9  good.

basically, i agree with fire's plan, but i have following suggestion:
1) is 16 NPC countries too many?  how about only 3 nations(Îº¡¢Êñ¡¢Îâ)? and
we should disable independent to make player serve the NPC nation
from begining
to the end. i remember someone complained here is not like Èı¹ú but much like
Îå´úÊ®¹ú, so maybe we make some change at new start.  obviously, not everyone
will agree with this, especially for those who r ambisious. however,
we can post
several plans and see player's reaction, or just let them vote to choose one.
2) for player becoming officer, i think lch's suggestion is very
good.  now a king
can set his officer at free will for money sack, which is
unreasonable.  to make
the nationdistribution or localdistribution as the guideline will be
more formal.
anyway, we may consider it.
3) about player's personal data, i suggest to set player's money
depends on his age.
becoz i didnt feel happy about current situation that everybody
independent for gold.
we may do as this manner: year 14: 10 gold, year 16: 20 gold, year
18: 30 gold, etc.
i know i will be hammerred everyday for this decision, hehe.

generally, none of us would like to see the next sanguo ending in doom, so we
have to consider over b4 making every decision.

regards.

1 put the new start on the new server. 
  The most advantage is the when we are testing, there were no players
  around to disturb. But we need the server to be ready to code in the
  mid of January. And there will be at least 24 hours for us to prepare
  in the new server before opening it to players. If the new server can't
  be ready in the middle of next January, we have to restart the mud on
  the old server first.
2 About player nations.
  Since no body unify the whole China in this round. So in next round,
  there will be no player counties. There will be only 16 NPC countries.
  The country arrangement can be check by "info r".
3 About ¹úÊ¦
  ¹úÊ¦'s power will be the same, but to become a ¹úÊ¦ need more national
  contribution. Currently it is 300. How about change it to 500?
4 The requirement for becoming an officer will be adjustment, the same as
  to become a local leader (some will according to lch's post)
5 If somebody interested, we may redesign the start page. (The current page
  is very good indeed, but a new front page give ppl the impression that
  we are new:)
6 About Independence
  The requirement is about the same, but we may add some penalty for a king 
  when his country is ruined. It will discourage ppl to got independence 
  just for some poket money. 
7 About countries
  Now flee has add the surrender for nation. It is ok. We will create ally for
  countries.
8 About other new stuff
  Any wizs if have new stuff which is
  a no much relationship with other big systems.
  b nearly done.
  Please apply so we can put it in the new start scheme.
9 About the players data
  Players' following data will be cleared
  a. national contribution
  b. local contribution
  c. national position
  d. local position
  Other data such as money, jiewei, liturate, house, and personal
stuffs will be 
  kept.
10 Schedule
  a I hope the plan can be determined before 1st January.
  b A tasklist will be add one day after the plan is approved.
  c the total code will be finished before 13th January.
  d the code will be tested and all data will be transfered before
14th January
  e The new start will be on 15th January
Please discuss and support :)

ÌâÄ¿: About restart
ÈÕÆÚ: Mon Dec 27 15:34:54 1999
Since everybody supports to restart. We will restart this mud. The
only difference is some people expect a "better plan" and "something
different" in the new era, and Stefan suggest we restart until we got
a new server. I think that is fine.

However, a better plan can not come from nowhere; there must be some ppl
to make it and to realize it. On the other hand, we can't expect that
a new start can solve everything. But definately a new start can bring 
new hopes and new excitings in some way. Generally speaking, what a new
year can bring to us? Nothing new, the same people and the same world. 
(of course, the world is changing, but it changes all the time, there is
no big leap among the new years) But we still use a lot energy to celebrate 
new years. And the coming new year is even special, it leads to a new century 
and I believe none of us can survive longer enough to meet the next turn 
of this big event. So I think it is a enough execuse for us to abort this 
round of Sanguo and to restart a new one.

About the plan. I have asked rob to make one, but seem he is not quite
good to make detailed plans. I will give a draft plan soon. And we can 
discuss it.

seems this sanguo era has to be ended in a unhappy way, too many
bad news, and too many rumors...how can we change this situation?
thats the question we all wizard staff need to think over.  to create
a new-type mud is difficult, and to manage it is even harder.  however,
we cannot totally ignore players' demands and complains.  there is
a new log for wizards regarding on decipline issue and is believed
a good start too, becoz we still need to do lots of things to make
this 'world' perfect, any problems coming from inside r fatal...
anyway, since most players and wizards support to restart, i dont have
objection, and if rob is able to provide a better plan, that will be
better.  Y2K is a milestone for human being, we all hope it can bring
good luck for sanguo, we love sanguo.

ps: well, wizlist gets 13 wizs, in order to decipline ourselves, i 
suggest to reconsider their positions according to their work.  and to
recruit new wizard has to be well-considerred becoz stefan found there
is already a copy of our sanguo outside. dunno if this is true but
we need to be alert from now on.

ÌâÄ¿: About changing the LPC engine.
ÈÕÆÚ: Tue Nov 23 05:03:23 1999
About Stefan's suggestion of changing LPC engine. I think we can consider
it. But not hurry, we will use some time to search the information of PIKE
and evaluate its potentiality and when we got familar with it and find it
is really a stable base, then we need to estimate the difficulty of migration.
and then do the migration.
  But the most important thing now is to finish this release first.
Because we have 
spent a lot time and energy on it. We simply need some results.
Somehow, perhaps
we can't put in every thing in the first release, but at least it works well
with the current stuff. It is obviously that we have some bugs in
the low level.
I hope we can figure them out and fix them. 
  Anyway, i think the mudos, even has some limitation, it is good
enough to support
current SanGuo Mud. and some of the shortage can be overcoverd.
Forexample, Mudos doesn't support access to database. It is sure now
we are using
some database based system. But unlike most database, the mapping
has it advantage
and also the number of records is not too big yet (no more than
2000). so perhaps
later we can invite some way to implenment some database operation
on small-sized
tables.
  About the Web, it is one part of the mud but not the essential
part for playing.
and we may use other web server and combined with our mud Cgi.
  Of course, if PIKE is far more advantaged than MudOS, we may shift
to it in the 
future, my opinion is that MudOS is capable to host this mud in
current stage :)
Regards
fire

ÌâÄ¿: plan of restart
ÈÕÆÚ: Wed Dec 29 02:14:04 1999
1 put the new start on the new server. 
  The most advantage is the when we are testing, there were no players
  around to disturb. But we need the server to be ready to code in the
  mid of January. And there will be at least 24 hours for us to prepare
  in the new server before opening it to players. If the new server can't
  be ready in the middle of next January, we have to restart the mud on
  the old server first.
2 About player nations.
  Since no body unify the whole China in this round. So in next round,
  there will be no player counties. There will be only 16 NPC countries.
  The country arrangement can be check by "info r".
  Row's suggestion is good. This mud is based on Sanguo, but when I play
  san guo pc game, I always like to choise the first stages which have more
  countries. In this case, I prefer more countries. But perhaps we can make
  three big countries and many small countries, how about this way. Anyway
  the previous arrange is designed by ice, if no objection, we will leave 
  this question solved by ice. so ICE, please make a list of countries and
  area and npc distribution. if you like, can just keep the old one, if row
  like, can give your suggestion directly to ice.
3 About ¹úÊ¦
  ¹úÊ¦'s power will be the same, but to become a ¹úÊ¦ need more national
  contribution. Currently it is 300. How about change it to 500?
  The reason to make the ¹úÊ¦'s power similar to the player king's power is
  try to make the npc country as strong as a player's country.
  But system may need a more restrict method to select a ¹úÊ¦ and
keep his position.
  I will do this part and will use some of ice's ideas.
  a change capital city, can only change from small city to big city
  b ¹úÊ¦ also will be evaluated every 3 years, if in this evaluation there
     is one or more players have higher nationalcontribution than ¹úÊ¦£¬
     system will choose randomly from them, this is right.
  c add a aggresive requirement of ¹úÊ¦£¬when a player's nationcontri
     arrives 500, he will become ¹úÊ¦£»every 3 sanguo yrs will be the
     period of reconsideration, a qualified ¹úÊ¦ must have 1000 more
     nationcontri each 3 sanguo yr, otherwise he will be demoted
    I will consider it.
4 The requirement for becoming an officer will be adjustment, the same as
  to become a local leader (some will according to lch's post)
5 If somebody interested, we may redesign the start page. (The current page
  is very good indeed, but a new front page give ppl the impression that
  we are new:) *point ice
6 About Independence
  The requirement is about the same, but we may add some penalty for a king 
  when his country is ruined. It will discourage ppl to got independence 
  just for some poket money. 
  I will do this part and give d
7 About countries
  Now flee has add the surrender for nation. It is ok. We will create ally for
  countries.
  if ìøÈÃ£¬the  former king will lose 60% of his reputation. in
current situation
  the ìøÈÃ will make the former king lost nearly every thing,
because he will be
  kick out from the char :(
  Can flee do the ally and other national relation part stuff?
8 About other new stuff
  Any wizs if have new stuff which is
  a no much relationship with other big systems.
  b nearly done.
  Please apply so we can put it in the new start scheme.
  This part is free to everyone, so everybody please make something
suprised bah.
9 About the players data
  Players' following data will be cleared
  a. national contribution
  b. local contribution
  c. national position
  d. local position
  e. about the money, some of the data such as poket money and money
in bank is stored
     in the player's datafile, so hard to modify it he is not on
line, so this time
     perhaps we just keep the money not changed.
  Other data such as money, jiewei, liturate, house, and personal
stuffs will be kept.
10 Schedule
  a I hope the plan can be determined before 1st January.
  b A tasklist will be add one day after the plan is approved.
  c the total code will be finished before 13th January.
  d the code will be tested and all data will be transfered before
14th January
  e The new start will be on 15th January
11 if no body object before 31 December, I will translate it into
chinese and announce 
   and every wiz please begins your part of work :)

1 cd /log
2 find -in fire LOGIN_FAIL
  then find :
2453  fire: Sat Nov 13 12:53:36 1999 À´×Ô£º202.96.154.193

2457  fire: Sat Nov 13 12:55:12 1999 À´×Ô£º202.96.154.193

  that means someone from 202.96.154.193 try 5 times to
  login as fire
3 then use find -in 202.96.154.193 logins and find:
  only guy (id hum) come from that id, so it is quite
  possible that hum try to guess my id. 

please pay attention about the safe of passwd :)

can use find -in <id> logins to check if someone from
other ip address has login your id

ÌâÄ¿: mirror and server relocation
ÈÕÆÚ: Sat Nov  6 23:49:47 1999
I am having trouble with the new server I mentioned last time, too.
If someone volunteer to host sanguo's server, it would be great.
However, there are things I am worrying about:

1. how secure is that server, not in terms of system security, but also the
people who manage it. So far, I am quite certain that nobody has ever got
a complete copy of our lib yet. But if somebody we never dealt with is
going to manage it, I am quite worried.

2. It is bad for the mud that the development gets branched, especially those
libs got pirated. Look at XKX back three years ago, how many people
have got the pirated copy and declare they own it and go on their
own branch of developing a mud. Few has been successful. 

3. We are not ready to release a version yet. Not to mention the bugs that
players are complaining about, but the main structures have not been 
settled yet. If we allow branching of development, we will
eventually face the incompatibility of all sorts. People will 
just hijack our code and declare they own it, it is their own sanguo :)
Just look at XKX, US XKX and China XKX are different.

4. An open source development group is the way to go. If we are not
afraid of releasing the secrets in the mudlib, we can build a webpage
and start to organize development over the internet, encourage
people to contribute their own code to the library.

Pretty much as I prefer number 4 as the future direction, but I am
afraid a mudlib is not suitable to be completely open, because people will
study the code and know all the secrets. I believe SanGuo is already
much different from traditional role playing muds. We do not have
many secrets to hide away from normal players. We set off with a goal
to build a dynamic mud.

I am trying to re-build our web page. If we are really going to
open up source codes, I think we should open up base lib first
before we open up SanGuo specific world source. How does that sound
to everyone? Lots of efforts are needed to accomplish this
goal though.

For mirrors, once we open up, there can be as many as they request.
As long as we reach an agreement that all development work based
on our source code should also be open to public, SanGuo lib will
live on forever :)

bring any unconvience to overseas player, but we can still
leave this site open.  i dunt think we should release a formal
version of sanguo now, just becoz we still didnt finish a
large part of our project yet....sigh. anyway, i am positive
with this suggestion.  but, we have met hacker b4, we should be

ÌâÄ¿: about our server.
ÈÕÆÚ: Sat Nov  6 14:56:32 1999

I think, Chinese Mud's life is in China. Sooner or later
we will migrate our mud to China. so how about open a
mirror in China now or move our main development to china.

Sure, our development has not been finished. But if your guys
agree, we can begin to standardlize our code and prepare
the first release.

I think we may have three choice:
  1 open a mirror in china
  2 move our development site to china
  3 release our code so players can build SanGuo freely

The reasons for this suggestion are:

  1 our server is not safe, we met two major crashes
  2 this mud's major player group is from china and this site is
    slow to them
  3 we need fresh blood, now most senior wizards in the mud are
    busy and our development speed becomes very slow
  4 we all have spended a lot time and energy on this mud freely
    because we love this game. and the only way to make this mud
   continue grow when we have to leave this mud is open it.

What your guys opinions ?

1  My windows don't have some DLL, so it can't run 
   ssh_1_2_22_win32. so I use a ssh_1_2_14_win32 to replace
   can they do the same work ?

2 I have downloaded WinCvs11b7 and it seems that the 
  install and run are both ok
3 I don't know what is the relationship of the ssh and cvs
4 in wincvs, what should i set in the Authentication
   SSH Server or "password" file one the cvs server
  when i set it to SSH Server i got the folloing message when i 
  try log in:
>NEW CVSROOT: fire@www.idstar.com:/export/home/suede/cvsroot (ssh
authentication)
>Set the password authentication first in the preferences !

 when i set it to "passwd" file on cvs server
 after i login it will ask me to enter the password
  and i find, no matter the password is right or not, both will give
  the return message as:
>cvs login 
>(Logging in to fire@www.idstar.com)
>cvs [login aborted]: recv() from server www.idstar.com: EOF
>*****CVS exited normally with code 1*****

so can anyone help me :)

ÌâÄ¿: about the data recovery for players
ÈÕÆÚ: Sun Sep 26 23:25:57 1999
as for this matter, i suggest only recover the personal
data for some main char, such as some kings, high-ranked
officers. i will write a post regarding this issue to players
and set a deadline for the loss reporting.
anyway, i think we cannot totally make up the loss so that maybe
is the best we can do.
what do u guys think?

ÌâÄ¿: away on trip
ÈÕÆÚ: Thu Sep 30 15:02:48 1999
sorry but I am away on a biz trip until 15 or 16 of October.
Moving to the new server thingy has to be postponed until I come 
back :)

to fire, the problems u have with CVS and SSH can be found at www.wincvs.org
there is a FAQ regarding this, CVS uses SSH to fetch files
and update files on the remote server, that is why you have to setup
both correctly.

I will have exams in these two weeks, and after that I will
lose my internet connection and then got to get a job.  Thus
I cannot continue to be here any more, at least for a not short
period.

I like this game and wiz group much, and feel sorry for I cannot
keep with the growth of it.  Hope we can get more workable wizs
in the future and when I can be back to this game, it's officially
open..:P

Sorry for I owed the task of fighting messages, could yuyin help
to finish them all?

I may be back take a look in these two weeks, but I am afraid that
I don't have time to work any more.

Anyway, it's my pleasure to work with u all, and thanks for all helped
me with everything..:)

Addoil!

we change it a little and make it accessable for

ÌâÄ¿: about the request of opening mirror site
ÈÕÆÚ: Wed Jun 30 12:23:13 1999
first of all, i think to open mirror site will be good.
however, I dun think it's the right time for us to take this action.
i think the major goal of this test version is general some new ideas
from player and discover bugs in game playing, if we open the mirror site
at present, i think we dun have enough energy to handle in 2 mud servers.:PP
i have met an example of opening a mirror site while the mud was not muture,
it's canada's sanguo.  they open a mirror site in shanghai, and let the
applicants to handle it at all, and just let it go.  however, the
cancda sanguo
was not muture and the new group was not acting as they promised,
after a period
of time, that mud died, and i think it brings a very bad image about
the mud game.

i strongly agree row's comment, we should open mirror sites after our mud is
officially open, and most important parts of the mud is bug free.

I think the main purpose of tianji's application is just to get the
mudlib, and let
some more ppl play it, but if we dun put enough effort in the new server, more
players will be meaningless to our jobs, bcoz we cannot handle the
feedback and bugs
efficiently and effectively.

ÈÕÆÚ: Mon Jul  5 02:57:48 1999
I suggest to open war on this week's weekend
it has several reasons
1 our mud need some ĞË·Ü¼Á
2 we need a chance to observe war's bugs

In order to make this war open more useful for further
development and cause less troubles, I think we can do the
following preparations

1 announce the open of war 2 or 3 days before the moment of open
  so most players can prepare it and we hope most related players
  can attend there during that time as well as most wizards

2 we keep the right to close the war at any moment in case it
  goes out of control.

3 I hope, most currently working wizards attending there
  and clearly record the process of the wars and the bugs
  so make these wars very fruitful.

What your guys think about this ?

1. look in war or train will consider enemy troops as friend troops,
   which are different from cmd warmap here
2. the bug that attack some area, or taishou only area, defence troop

About the dummy spies, i think it's coming to be more and more

spy to enemy nation is not a bad thing, but should be treated

When a player login, finger will show his id instead of showing ip
from the player finger, when he tries to login more than 1 id, finger
may indicate the 2nd id or later ids by using the first logged in id.
if the first id logged out, the 2nd one will be the indicator.

I think this way can make players know better to control dummy spies,
however, if sb really wants to make some spies, he has to quit his id
and play his dummy to get his target player's trust, i think it's the
way to solve the currently dummy spy problem.

Well, if a ppl has more than 1 IP to play with, i think we cannot
control at all, it's not a problem of multilog any more, so i think
it's not much concerning about fair, after all, we cannot treat every
player equally fair...:P

looking forward for discussion

yeah, i agree with ice, we should make finger
more powerful. such as in xkx, finger will sort
the players according to their ips, which means
players from same or similar ips will put together

I'm a player of sanguo. And I'm zzfy's arch. We have a server
with 5.6G disk driver. We can use all the spaces. But we haven't
enough program to fit. So we want to be a mud site. Now we have fy
with a Sun 3500 server, and we have a better server, with enough space.
I like sanguo very much, I think it's very good. And about 30-40 of
my friends want to play sanguo too. And not every people here can login
the server out of China. So would you give me a chance to open a site
of sanguo? You can update the files when you want.
Sorry my English is poor, I'm junior student. Please forgive me.
Please write back soon even we can't do that. Thanks.

geez...someone please enlighten me on what Ğ­»á do,

hmm, from my understanding of mass production (ÏÖ´ú»¯´óÉú²ú),
pishou's cup making example is like 2 ppl need to
divide the work into 1 person make ±­µ×, another one
make ±­±ú, one person do the first shaping, another
one add colours, another one put the cup into oven, etc
but then, what's the point? aren't we ·Ö¹¤ already?
aren't they ·Ö¹¤ already? if he really wants a club to
½»Á÷, why not we all just goto some other site (like
a wizschool) and chat our ideas, problems, solutions?
Also, i only learned about "team work" in my classes, not
"mass production" per se...was i getting bad education?

huh? so pishou wanted 2 different muds with 2 
different wiz teams? that's exactly status quo yeah...
papaya tset, i am very confused now
> 
> Ò¶¹«

hmm...i remember there used to be a talk of ºÏ×÷ too
before, but get no where...  I really like to see
pishou's plan of Ğ­»á, be it a guild of sanguo wizs
or a company to develop graphics mud.

i agree with stefan, these two muds are totally
difference from each other, unification is nearly
impossible.
howerver, both of us use SGZ as story base and have
a similar core idea, focus on the coorpation of players
rather than indivadule effect. it will be good to both
of us if we can change ideas frequently.

ÌâÄ¿: about the new feature of war system
ÈÕÆÚ: Wed May 19 19:31:57 1999
Hi, flee and group.
I think that in current situation, introduce more feature to
the war system will be very hard.
your ideas of more type of troops are very nice.
but now easy to develop in a short time.
especially now the war system still has a lot bugs.
so I suggest that you can keep on trying for an extra week, 
if still can not open the war and make sure no fatal bugs and affect
for other system, then i will be fine
If can not finish that within one week.
I strongly suggest you delay your plan until next version
then we will redesign the war system.
Then you can work on job systems.
now the job of landlord still has bugs.
and we still need jobs related to our d_obj.
in fact, we have a lot thing that must do before the
opening of this mud (hope in next month). and the improvement of war
is not so emergency.

best regards

fire

I think it is very important, espeicily our basic jobs
are even harder than middle level jobs. We should reconsider
the dificulties and rewards, to make sure that a player
without any MUDing experience still can survive.

  	 how about the ÏÉÈË in SGZ, such as Ë¾Âí»Õ, »ªÍÓ,
etc. let them give jobs. acctually we can make it more 
close to real history, for example, »ªÍÓ may ask a player
to find some grass for medicine .. :)
   e landlord (flee)
	Now, Landlord is the only job which is related the
city's condition, which can increase the Aragriculture of
that city and increase gold and food as well. as i metioned
in part 4), I will create some more job which will related 
to Industry, Bussiness and Techinical .. etc.

my opinion: although most of those tasks he apply can be done as a

so we may consider his application. for the problem that liyu cannot
be a king when he becoming a wiz (i suggest he to register a new
id), pls think out a way to solve it.

old players and new players...so maybe there could be
a high limit of skills? like 100?  just to make sure

ÌâÄ¿: IMPORTANT, ALL WIZARDS PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
ÈÕÆÚ: Tue Dec  1 13:16:51 1998
This is the board just used to post news related to 
wizard committee. Now we have five members in this 
committee they are stefan, tset, flee, row and fire.
This board is used to collect suggestions (each 
suggestion should be solved as approve or unapprove
within no more than one week) and post members opinion
on suggestions. Every wizards has right to give 
suggestion( just post here). once just make one suggestion.
If you have more, please post them differently so we 
can discuss them differently. and make the suggestion 
clear. (an obscure suggestion may be refused). 
Every member of the committee is supposed to post
his opionion about each suggestion clearly and quickly.
He should make it clear that he supports one suggestion
or against. Expra explain and comment are also welcomed.
After one suggestion is given, each member is expected
to give his opinion by post here. If he did post anything
about that suggestion within one week. we will consider
this situation by two ways. one is that he has login during
that time another is that he didn't login in that time.
If he indeed login in that time but didn't give any respond
about a suggestion, we will take it as he SUPPORT that
suggestion as DEFAULT and this will reduce his reputation
in this committee for not fulfiling his duty. If he didn't
login during that period, then we will remove his name out
of the committee temporarily. and the result of this suggestion
will be determined by a smaller group of the committee.
Did I make this rules clear? any one has anything unclearly,
please just post your question out. And this rules will be
approved unless more than one committee member post agains it.
If no more than one ppl against this, this will be used
until we other suggestion against this rules approved.
xixi:)
cheers

ÌâÄ¿: The work as an admin in the mirror site.
ÈÕÆÚ: Wed Feb 23 17:49:35 2000
The admin in the mirror site will not going to do and programming
there. The reason is simple, he can't even view the source code
in the mirror site. Now I list what an admin may do in a mirror.
1 To watch and report bugs 
  As you all know, because our system is much more complex than 
  other Chinese Mud, so there are many bugs in our system. This
  maybe even more obvious in a new mirror. For example because the
  lack of severl news group caused some room unaccessable is a very
  typical bug in mirrors. To watch bug is simple, just need
  a chan errors /on        This will open the error message channel
  b When find some error message, use 
    dbxwhere last,  to findout which files caused the bug and some
    information.
  c Then use dbxframe last <frame number> to view the source code which
    caused the error message. and report them to main site.

2 To handle urgent events.
  In most situation, the bug doesn't cause too much trouble, but 
  sometimes, it may cause a player traped in a mache or in the war field.
  In this case, they need urgent help from a wiz.
  In certain cases, bugs may cause disaster lose for a country or an area,
  and we are responsible to recover their lose.

3 To find if there are some ways to cheat in our mud.
  New players may find new ways to cheat. One example is they find can
  give other players money by type put gold in <sb>. 

4 Help new players.
  Our mud is so different from other chinese muds that many players find
  it's hard to begin in our mud. Even though we have plenty help files,
  few players have the patient to read at begining and some of the helps
  are missleading. I have goto Tsing's BBS and find there is a warm discuss
  about our mud. But I find none of the post can really tell others what
  our mud is like. In other word, few ppl really understand what mud it is.
  So we need some highhand and wizs from main site to help them getting 
  start.

5 Post and announce the new progress
  Now several systems are under development, and each day we may release 
  something new. So the admin in the mirror need announce and post these
  progresses.

6 Deal with complains.
  Different site may have different problems. xfan has raise two problem.
  One is use channnel to flood, another is a none char player will lost
  most of his stuff when disconnected, which are quite common on his site.
  When we got these complain, we can modify our code to solve the problems.
  If we can't, it's better to give some explains.

Anyway, a mirror difinately need an admin from main site to work there. And
it's not necessary to be the programer.
Of cause, I can do some of the work, but I can't do all. I've heard that
the farm in FZ site can't work. I try to figure it out but find it's
impossible.
That site is TOO LAG for me. On other hand, I don't have so much time to
look after more than 2 sites. So I raise this problems and want every wizs
share this task. I believe every one in our wiz team can be a good admin
in the mirror site, because he has a full team backup him and can always 
goto the main site to check code and seeking for help.

ÌâÄ¿: About the admin of mirror site
ÈÕÆÚ: Tue Feb 22 20:12:48 2000
Now we are going to open more and more mirrors. I think for
each mirror, we should have one or two members in our wiz
group to be the admin there to help maintain and deal with
bugs. I suggest to share the chance and tasks among the wiz
group. Each senior wiz has the responsiblity and right to 
admin one or two mirror.
