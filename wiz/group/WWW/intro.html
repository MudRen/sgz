<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Hi, my friend..: @_^</font></p>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">This is my personal profile and
self introduction. Since you enter this page, you are at least
one of my friends, and hence i hope you can enjoy watching this
and will not feel boring with the page.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">I am a 3rd year student in
National University of Singapore, the major is electrical
engineering with computer engineering stream. My friends said
this is a good department of NUS and have very high quality in
education, so I hope when I graduate, i can be a good and skilled
engineer deal with lots of stuffs, especially in computer domain.
Hence although i am not good at programming and computer based
working, i will try my best to realize what i said...^O^</font></p>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">My favourable stuffs are mud,
comics, games as well as sports. I have a lot of friends in
different muds, this is a thing i can be proud of...xixi...maybe
you are also one of them? *wink...*snicker... If the answer is
yes, great, dont forgot to give me some comment in main page...if
not, never mind, when you are playing mud, dont forgot call me
yor, in some muds, i am really rich lee...haha</font></p>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">I wont say anything about the
comics and computer games, you can see those stuffs in my
personal interest pages. Here i just want to mention sports. As
what i have told to gem, there are four kinds of sports which i
dont know how to play: swimming(*blush), skating, ski, dance(if
dance can be treat as a type of sport). Of course I dont know how
to play those national games which maybe i never heard, but
actually i can play really all other international games...but...
all just know. This is not a good pattern, right? know everything
but cant be good at anything...My favourate sport is soccer,
since when I was in primary school, I am the goalkeeper of the
school team...*laughproud...so poor cant continue play that
position la, because my eyes has almost equal to a mouse la....
that is also a side-effect of mud and computer games ba.</font></p>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">My hometown is Wuhan, which is
lying in the center of P.R China, our great motherland. I spent
18 years in my howe town with sunny and rainy, then i was chosed
and was sented to singapore as a scholar. To be a scholar is not
a suitable thing, because cant see a lot of old friends la.
Another important reason is because money is so
short...hoho...sometimes i spent money really fast... even
without thought. In this case, i think I maybe also have the
problem of idiot, do things without through brain...haha</font></p>

<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Hmm...I cant find anyother things
worth to mention. If you want to know me more, just email me at
the email address applied in the main page... thanks a
lot...^_&amp;</font></p>
