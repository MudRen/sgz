accually, i start with huoji when code jimou.
but it is not easy to handle it .. :(
my idea is, huoji will cost not only player's jimou,
but also stuff, let's say, a player can put some woods 
in certain area, then cast huiji.
and fire can spread with effect of wind and weather ... 
i will try to implement it after all other jimous open ..

题目: about qibin
日期: Fri Feb 25 06:12:48 2000
I think ice's idea is right
maybe qibing is suitable for small troop say soldiers
number less than 2k, and maifu can be used for any size of troop

each jimou have a busy time, which can be listed by info jimou
this parameter accually limit the number of jimous used in the
battle field. we can adjust it to optmize the effect.
about consume, i think in future, troop will carry stuff.
so we can leave comsumption until stuff is fully implemented

日期: Fri Feb 25 01:20:06 2000
I didn't check much about jimou, so maybe my openion is not correct.
Howevey, can we limit the total times of jimou used in one war. Is it
reasonable to use more than 10 times of jimou in a war? Can we limit
each side in a war just use at most 5 times of jimou. In this situation,
the players need really think about which jimou is the most suitable 
in certain situation rather than just use it as a special attack?
And we may increase the effect of the jimou if it used in the right way.
This is only my idea for consideration. Don't mind if find difficult to
implement. 
Another thing is about the food and gold consuming. Because now the troops
don't bring any stuff with them, can we just make them consume food and gold
and other stuffs from their original area?

题目: balance of jimou
日期: Fri Feb 25 00:32:48 2000
i watched several wars, and got the feeling that qibing is the jimou
used most frequently, its comparetively having higher chance to succeed
and the function it brings is great. however the only jimou against qibing
is scout, which is hardly to succeed and the usage is limited, coz we know
a troop with qibing can hide and go everywhere freely until the time passed.
flee or group, please reconsider and balance it a little bah. :)
besides, compare to qibing, maifu is useless...should make these 2 jimou
totally different on fuction and same effection.

agreed,
in fact, there are many more features we can add in .. 
such as guwu, my ideas is that this jimou will consume some
gold, stuff, etc .. also 
but currently, we can not implement these ideas, .. cos 
mutli-troops system .. etc is not ready yet ..
anyway, we will make jimou more reasonable and realistic 
with the develoment of other systems .. 
*hoho*

题目: about number of player's jimou
日期: Fri Feb 25 00:23:13 2000
Nowadays player are restricted to learn a certain number of
jimou, but now i have a different idea about it.

Today i watched a war, seems all players are using jumou "qibing"
in the war, but it's not my original idea of qibing, it's mis-used.
I think only some light troops can use this kind of jimou, but now
all players r using it to get close to enemy, it reduced the interest
of the war, i think.

then i got another idea of restriction of jimou, that's player can
learn any jimou they like, but cannot use them all in the same war,
that is, if player in different troops, they can cast different jimou
in the war.  For example, if a player in a infantry, they cannot
cast qibing, but in a cavalry, they can then....

how do u guys think about it?
