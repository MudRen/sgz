房间要有一比花消。等升官有钱了，可以将房子卖掉，也可以转让
他人(费用是原价的0.5-2倍)

additional note: house cannot be moved easily, once a player changes
his area, he need to pay a certain cost regarding to his house level,
function room level, and items amount inside his house.:P

it's a simple mode, i can imagine the pro mode must be more fun and
complex.  later a player can be a kind of builder and trader except
being an officer only.  Being officer is not the only goal of this mud
anyway, so let's wait and develop more and more funny stuffs here.:)
