1.  I strongly disagree this people's point, because in our
    mud, we encourage fair competition only.

2.  At present, the jobs for newbies are still insufficient,
    they always find out that working in huayin is bored and
    no fun.

3.  This mud still has tons of bugs, we need to do a lot of 
    jobs to debug, so I suggest we don't have to open mirror
    site in a hurry.

4.  Due to the serious bugs in war, we will postpone the date
    of war re-open.

5.  We have around 99 areas, 2000 rooms, and 500 objects,
    meanwhile, there are about 500 NPC/characters existing.
    If we don't code them in most efficient and effective ways,
    it may cause a very high CPU consumption, which may make
    the server crash time to time.
