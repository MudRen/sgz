note: in the currently existing local positions, 武将 in lv 3 city is a kind
      of confusing with 武将 in lv 1 and lv 2 cities; on the other hand, no.
      of positions in city differs the cities levels, i changed some numbers
      of positions. I erased all 副将 position and replaced it as 牙将, and
      put 武将 in lv 4 and lv 5 cities, to standardlize the positions.

note: 

1. the max number of one troop depends on the leader's ability to manage only, 
   other officers in the same troops will have some other usages later, like 
   侦察，埋伏 blah blah, will be implement later.

2. added local contri as a requirement, basicjob->findbody need to be adjusted,
   thus player officer cannot change his city unless his king or 国师 permited.

3. added loyalty of taishou position, when a taishou or a king wanna pos the
   taishou position to an existing officer, has to consider his loyalty first, 
   otherwise the officer cannot be taishou, hope it can help to solve the dummy
   taishou a little.

4. suggest to add a requirement of officers transfering, for example, if a king
   named sb as taishou, or transfer an officer to a new city, this taishou or 
   officer cannot be transfered again within 1 mud year.  if a real taishou pos
   his taishou position to an officer in his city, he is supposed that he cannot
   get it back within 1 mud month.

5. national positions setting will be suggested later.
