the map you gave me last time was pretty good actually, just
that the cities should be separate from the map . Then
I can make a program to place city image on the correct
position with different color and different size :)

题目: about web page
日期: Sat Jan 29 04:22:29 2000
I am going to have a vacation back in China, so I will put some more
work on the web page itself, but dont expect them to be updated 
until I come back :)

The things planned are:
1. per user account. I will try to associate it with the name and 
password in the mud.
2. CVS access and online code access. This was already planned for
the next open source movement. But now got some problems, hope can
be solved soon.
3. post articles on web page, or even let players have individual webpage???

题目: register our webpage
日期: Sat Jan 29 11:06:21 2000
I remember there is some programs can register the web address
to many search engines, but I dun remember the name.:(

I think our advertisement should be in 2 ways:
1. register our web page to main search engines(manually or by some software),
2. encourage player to create their own webpage to ad for us,
   we can give some rewards to that kind of activities.:P
