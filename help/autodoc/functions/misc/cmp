returns whether its two arguments are equivalent.  This is about
the same as using the equivalence operator (==), but will return true
in cases where == does not, such as when comparing 2 arrays.
Logically 2 arrays should be equivalent, but aren't with ==.
cmp knows they are.  This is mainly useful when you want to compare
mappings and arrays.
