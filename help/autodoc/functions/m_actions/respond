Does a command [using do_game_command] after a small delay.  This is the
best way to have NPCs react to events, as a slight delay makes it a bit
more believable, and also if you do things immediately, the action may
PRECEDE the thing you are responding to.  Example: Troll which attacks
anyone who says 'foo'.  I say 'foo', you and the troll are in the room.
If the message is delivered to the troll before you, the troll will attack
me BEFORE the message gets to you.
