Call a set of hooks, with the specified method for resolving multiple
hooks.  A setting from /include/hooks.h can be used, or a function pointer
which is appropriate for implode()ing with the return values.

E.g.

 call_hooks("foo", (: $1 + $2 :), 2) will return 2 + the sum of the return
     values of the hooks

 but 2 + call_hooks("foo", HOOK_SUM) is faster.
