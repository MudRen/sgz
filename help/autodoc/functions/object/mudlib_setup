 This function is overloaded by all mudlib objects deriving from
 this class.  They should inherit as necessary.  The intention of
 overriding this instead of create() to is ensure that the mudlib
 initialization completes _before_ the call to the area coder's
 setup() function.  Specifically, the mudlib objects need to
 initialize defaults that will then be changed by the setup() call.
 Note that if the mudlib object overrode create(), then its init
 code would occur _after_ the area coder's setup() and possibly
 blow away some of their settings.
