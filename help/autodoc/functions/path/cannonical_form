Change object path names to standard form, stripping the trailing .c, if
any, the clone number, if any, and making sure the leading / exists.

This function is useful for making sure that alternate forms of the
pathname match correctly, since:
cannonical_form("foo/bar") == cannonical_form("/foo/bar.c")
