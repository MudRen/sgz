Provide a list of objects to be loaded now and at every reset.  The key
should be the filename of the object, and the value should be the number
of objects to clone.  The value can also be an array, in which case the
first element is the number of objects to clone, and the remaining elements
are arguments that should be passed to create() when the objects are cloned.

Note:  the number already present is determined by counting the number of
objects with the same first id, and objects are only cloned to bring the
count up to that number.
